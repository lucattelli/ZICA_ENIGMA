Z Instant Comprehensive ABAP - The Enigma Machine Demo

### Introduction

The Enigma Machine is a cryptography device that was used by Germany during the World War II. It granted secure communications between military headquarters and troops. Because it's design is so simple, cheap and portable, Enigmas can be used anywhere, and they were.

My interest on it went high after I watched The Imitation Game. The film tells the story of Alan Turing's Bombe project, the machine that helped the Allies break Enigma's cipher. How can a design be so simple and yet (at that time) so secure?

So I decided that I should learn more about it. And so I did. I read articles, manuals and watched talks until I finally learned all of it's inner workings. In the process, I also learned some and reviewed other core principles on cryptography and electronics. Once I thought I knew enough, I decided to try to implement a version of this machine using object-oriented ABAP. 

This project is the result of that effort.

### Project Goals

I knew from the very first day that this project is useless. Afterall, Enigma's cipher isn't useful anymore. But at the same time, the process of understanding and building it is a very nice exercise on the basics of ABAP programming, Object-oriented programming and cryptography.

So I believe that, in fact, this project have a beautiful and valuable goal: the journey. Yes, if you're starting out as a programmer, specially in the ABAP programming language, this project holds many interesting things for you to learn. It will be a very funny challenge, where the prize will be only one thing: knowledge.

Also, if you're a teacher on any of those topics, I welcome you to use this project in your class. As any open source software, it may contain flaws and bugs that maybe your students can find, fix and then submit their patches to me. I'll be very thankful for that.

TLDR: The goal for this project is merely educational.
